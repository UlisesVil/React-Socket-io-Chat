# React - Socket.io Chat App

The basis of the development of this app is React on the frontend, hosted on GitHub pages, and Node JS, Socket.io, and Express on the backend with the Heroku service. Furthermore, the application is fully responsive.

We use the UUID library to generate secure and automatic IDs to log in to the application. You can also add the phone number as an ID, although there are still restrictions in the code to identify that other users do not log in with the same number.

The user will be able to add contacts and will be able to establish individual or group conversations.

The data of this application is store in Local Storage.
